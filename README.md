# Google-Books-React-Search
This is a React-based Google Books Search app. This app requires us to  create React components, work with util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. We also also use Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later.

# How it works
1. The project has both Frontend and backend,
2. we run node server.js to start our server,
3. then we run npm start to get our client server running.
